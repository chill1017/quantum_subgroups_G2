\section{Introduction}

This paper gives generators-and-relations presentations for two categories 
\[
    \cat{q_3}_{A_3} \quad \text{and} \quad \cat{q_4}_{A_4}
\] 
where $A_3$ and $A_4$ are the commutative Etale algebras corresponding, respectively, to the conformal embeddings $G_{2,3} \subseteq E_{6,1}$ and $G_{2,4} \subseteq D_{7,1}$ of affine Lie algebras. 
The correspondence $H_k \xleftrightarrow{} \ol{\Rep(U_{q_k}(\hh))}$ between affine Lie algebra representations and quantum group representations \cite{} allows one, in the course of studying conformal embeddings, to move freely from the perspective of affine Lie algebras to that of representations of quantum groups. 
We will initialize our statements in the language of affine Lie algebras, and then translate into quantum group representations.

By {\it presentation} we mean the following standard sequence of steps. 
Let $\PP$ be the planar algebra generated by some object of the tensor category $\CC$. 
Then we show $\PP$ is monoidally equivalent to some skein category $\EE$, and that $\Ab(\EE)$ is monoidally equivalent to $\CC$. 
The presentations we give are extensions of Kuperberg's $G_2$ skein theory by strands of type $\Z_3$ (level 3) and $\Z_2$ (level 4). 

The novel methodology offered here is the use of graph planar embeddings to deduce relations. 
Computing, e.g., the relation (Change of Basis) purely in the context of quantum group representations is daunting, to say the least. 
With a GPA embedding in hand, however, this becomes an elementary linear algebra problem.

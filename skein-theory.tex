\section{Skein Theory Generalities}

The goal of this section is to develop the tools needed to prove evaluability in a certain class of extensions of trivalent categories.
Namely we define the concept of a {\it $\Z_n$-like extension} of an {\it Euler-evaluable} trivalent category.
We expect this class of extensions to be helpful in the search for novel categories.
For example, there is work underway by the present author and Edie-Michell to use the techniques of this paper to 
construct a possibly infinitely large class of examples of {\it near-group} categories \cite{gannon_near-groups}.
This work on near-group categories \cite{cain_me_near-group} extends an underlying $SO(3)_q$ trivalent skein theory.
The present author has also begun work \cite{unpublished work} on a family of extensions of $SP(4)_q$, which, despite its skein theory being
generated by a braid, is of the same essence. 


This all begs the question of which leaves on the ``tree of life'' \cite{tricats} may be extended in this way.
We expect this tree to bear much fruit of this variety.
Already we have extended both categories ($SO(3)_q$ and $Fib$) covered by \cite[Theorem A]{tricats} by group-like objects.
This paper deals with all but one of the categories covered by \cite[Theorem B]{tricats}.
The categories one might next attempt such an extension of include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The remaining category $ABA$ of \cite[Theorem B]{tricats}
    \item The category $H_3$ of \cite[Theorem C]{tricats}
\end{itemize}

Now let us get to work defining the class of extensions we've been alluding to.
Both of the categories studied in this paper are extensions of trivalent categories by a colored, directed, $\Z_n$-like strand. 
The trivalent categories we deal with have evaluation algorithms based on the standard Euler characteristic argument.
One way to capture this evaluability is by considering dimensions of {\bf box spaces}.
In a trivalent category we let $B(k,f)$ be the span of diagrams $k\to0$ with $f$ internal faces.
The Euler characteristic argument for evaluability may be phrased as requiring
\[
    \dim B(k,1) \leq \dim B(k,0)
\]
for $k=1,\dots,5$.
We will refer to a trivalent category which exhibits such a property {\bf Euler-evaluable}.

General methods for demonstrating evaluability of a skein theory involve identifying some measure of complexity for a closed diagram, then showing the known relations allow one to strictly decrease this measure. 
For our underlying trivalent categories, Euler-evaluability allows us to decrement one measure of complexity: number of internal faces. 
With the new strand type, we have another measure: number of colored strands. 
We concatenate face count with colored strand count to obtain a lexicographic measure of complexity. 
% The following result gives sufficient conditions to decrement this complexity.

The following notation will be useful in writing down relations in $\Z_n$-like extensions.
\begin{definition}
    Suppose a diagram $E$ has $m$ boundary points. We define $dec_i(E)$ to be the $i$-th external single clockwise decorations of $E$. For example,
    \[
        dec_1\left(\skein{/skein_figs/trivalent}{0.15}\right) = \skein{/skein_figs/rightDown}{0.1},
    \quad
    \text{and} 
    \quad
        \sum_{i=1}^{m} dec_i\left(\skein{/skein_figs/trivalent}{0.15}\right) = \skein{/skein_figs/rightDown}{0.1} +\skein{/skein_figs/bottomLeft}{0.1} +\skein{/skein_figs/leftUp}{0.1}
    \]
    We adopt the convention that $dec_0 (E) = E$.
\end{definition}

Finally we define the class of categories we will be working with, and show they are evaluable in general.
\red{
    I actually don't think we need the n-generator.
    If we have an order constraint (i.e., $n$ neighboring strands pop), we get the generator and its absorbtion for free.

\begin{definition}\label{def:eval-criteria}
    Let $\CC = \left\langle \skein{/skein_figs/trivalent}{0.15} \right\rangle$ 
    be a trivalent category that is Euler-evaluable. 
    Call $\DD$ a {\bf $\Z_n$-like extension} of $\CC$ if 
    $\DD = \left\langle \skein{/skein_figs/trivalent}{0.15}, \skein{/skein_figs/Pg}{0.15}, map n\to0\right\rangle$

    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}



Under the above conditions we have the following fact.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:eval-criteria}
    
\end{proposition}





Under the conditions of \ref{def:eval-criteria} we obtain the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ext-dec}
    A decorated diagram may be expressed as a combination of externally decorated diagrams
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove the lemma for a decorated trigon, and leave the remaining cases to the reader. 
    \red{All less decorated cases are absorbed in this analysis.}
    Consider a maximally-decorated trigon:
    \[
        \skein{/skein_figs/dec_3gon1}{0.2}
    \]
    with any labeling on the colored strands. We apply the relations (Swap) and (Slide) on the internal colored strands to obtain a combination of diagrams of the form
    \[
        \skein{/skein_figs/dec_3gon2}{0.2}
    \]
    Now apply (Change of Basis) to reduce to a combination of diagrams of the form
    \[
        \skein{/skein_figs/dec_3gon3}{0.2}
    \]
    By another application of (Slide) and (Change of Basis) we arrive at a diagram of the form 
    \[
        \skein{/skein_figs/dec_3gon4}{0.2}
    \]
    During this last step, we pick up colored strands between the black ``spokes''; one may happily move these out of the diagram.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:eval-criteria}]
    Suppose we begin with a closed diagram consisting of a single black connected component.
    Begin by applying relations from the underlying trivalent category's evaluation algorithm; this decreases the number of trivalent vertices.
    By the standard Euler characteristic calculation, there must remain some black $n$-gon with $n\in\{ 2,\dots,5 \}$.
    Choose one such face and apply Lemma~\ref{lem:ext-dec} to reduce it to a singly-externally-decorated $n$-gon.
    Now one of the relations (decBigon), (decTrigon), (decTetragon), or (decPentagon) allows us to pop the face.
    This process decreases the number of faces (ignoring colored strands) in diagrams by at least 1 at every step.
    When only two faces remain we use the bigon relation to obtain a loop; apply (decStick) and the underlying loop relation to obtain a scalar.
    
    The case wherein the initial closed diagram has more than one black connected component requires more analysis.
    In this case the original diagram consists of multiple diagrams like that in the previous case, connected by colored strands.
    The above case tells us that each black component may be simplified to a single black loop.
    Our diagram now consists of a number of black loops, connected by colored strands.
    Use (Recouple) to make it so every black loop has either only in-strands or out-strands attached to it.
    
    If any black loop has more or less than $n$ strands entering or exiting (Schur 0) implies the whole diagram is zero.
    So suppose each black loop has exactly $n$ strands entering or exiting.
    If each black loop has only one neighbor, then repeated application of (Order) pops the chain.
    \red{
        Count the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item number of possible vertices mod $n$
            \item number of edges mod $n$
            \item number of nodes reachable from a given vertex
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{proof}

For each quantum subgroup we construct, we will find planar algebras satisfying the conditions of Proposition~\ref{prop:eval-criteria}, and thus will know the planar algebras are evaluable.

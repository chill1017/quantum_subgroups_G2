\section{Equivalences}

In this section we prove that the categories $\DD_3$ and $\DD_4$ are indeed
presentations for quantum subgroups of $\GG_2(q_3)$ and $\GG_2(q_4)$, respectively.
More details of the argument used may be found in \cite{cain_noah}.
It is necessary to note that from [\red{TODO}] we know that the nontrivial Etale algebras 
in $\ol{\Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))}$ and $\ol{\Rep(U_{q_4}(\gg_2))}$ are $A_3$ and $A_4$, respectively.



\begin{theorem}\label{thm:level-3}
    There is a monoidal equivalence
    \[
        \Ab(\ol{\DD_3}) \cong \ol{ \Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))}_{A_3}.
    \]
\end{theorem}

Corollary \red{TODO} tells us that $\ol{\DD_3}$ is unitary;
this follows from our $\dagger$-embedding of $\DD_3$ into $\GPA(\Gamma_3)$ and evaluability of $\DD_3$.
We immediately have the following corollary.
\begin{corollary}
    The embedding $\GG_2(q_3) \hookrightarrow \DD_3$ descends to a $\dagger$-embedding
    $\ol{\GG_2(q_3)} \hookrightarrow \ol{\DD_3}$.
\end{corollary}

From here we take Karoubi completion.

\begin{proposition}
    There is an Etale algebra $B_3$ such that 
    \[
        \Ab(\ol{\DD_3}) \cong \ol{ \Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))}_{B_3}.
    \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Taking Karoubi completion of the source and target of $\ol{\GG_2(q_3)} \hookrightarrow \ol{\DD_3}$
    induces a functor 
    \[
        \Ab( \ol{\GG_2(q_3)} ) \hookrightarrow \Ab( \ol{\DD_3} )
    \]
    which is faithful exact.
    By Lemma~\ref{lem:exact-functor}, we deduce that
    \[
        \Ab(\ol{\DD_3}) \cong \Ab( \ol{\GG_2(q_3)} )_{B_3}.
    \]
    But it is well known that 
    \[
        \Ab( \ol{\GG_2(q_3)} ) \cong \ol{ \Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))}.
    \]
\end{proof}

Now we are in a position to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:level-3}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:level-3}]
    As we noted before, the only candidates for $B_3$ are $A_3$ and $\unit$.
    Thus it will suffice to demonstrate that 
    \[
        \Ab(\ol{\DD_3}) \not\cong \ol{ \Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))} \cong \ol{ \Rep(U_{q_3}(\gg_2))}_{\unit}.
    \]
    % Let $X\coloneq V_{\Lambda_1}$, and let $Y\coloneq \FF_{A_3}(X)$ be the image of $X$ under the free functor.
    % Recalling that $A_3 = V_{\emptyset} \oplus V_{\Lambda_1}$, we may use a direct fusion graph computation to see
    % \[
    %     \dim\Hom
    % \]
    \red{
        D3 has 3 dimensions of $2 \to 1$ but how do we push this through isomorphisms to make this correspond to something in Rep?
        What do objects of D3 go to in these isomorphisms?
        Not clear.
    }
\end{proof}
